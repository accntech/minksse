# SSE HTTP benchmark results

Generated 2026-11-01T15:50:25.190Z. Setup: **optimized**, effective strategies {"minksse":{"bridge":"minksse-node","fastify":"send","better":"batch","cork":"off","native":"batch","minkApi":"emit","coalesceBytes":16384}}. 16 concurrent clients × 20000 events; 128-byte ASCII payload per event, batch 16, interval 0 ms.

5 measured repeats, 1 full warmup pass(es) per fresh server. v24.12.0, Apple M4 Pro, darwin/arm64.

| Candidate | Median events/s | Mean events/s (95% CI) | Median completion ms | Median first event ms | Median per-trial p95 first event ms | Median server CPU ms | Median RSS after MiB |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| minksse | 1,068,967.32 | 1,069,236.22 (1,061,258.73–1,077,213.71) | 299.35 | 1.38 | 1.74 | 331 | 86.52 |

All recorded streams passed exact event-count, order, payload and HTTP validation. Any error aborts the run without writing a successful report.

Throughput includes connection/request overhead, socket delivery and independent client validation. Both processes share this machine; client CPU and scheduler contention can cap results. Small samples and wide confidence intervals do not establish a reliable ranking. The Student-t interval describes mean throughput across these repeats, not a production guarantee.

The native baseline uses Node HTTP writes. Hono includes its router; Fastify includes its router and plugin. Hono, sveltekit-sse and MinkSSE use the selected per-candidate Web Response → Node HTTP adapter (effective strategies above). sveltekit-sse uses its real published producer bundled by esbuild; SvelteKit routing and the package clients are outside this measurement. Native/Hono/Fastify await exposed write backpressure; producer APIs cannot be made identical in that respect. See README.md for scope and reproducibility.

Package versions: @hono/node-server 2.1.5, hono 4.13.16, fastify 5.12.7, @fastify/sse 0.6.1, better-sse 0.16.1, sveltekit-sse 0.15.1, svelte 5.57.3, @sveltejs/kit 2.70.3, esbuild 0.28.2.

Raw samples and environment: native-pass-scalar.json. Local MinkSSE source commit 8868f9001c4d21c71cdcc94315f7d2d946f5b5e4; dirty checkout: true. The JSON includes the local compiled server and dependency lock hashes.
